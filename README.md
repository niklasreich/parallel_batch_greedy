## Installation
### Necessary Packages

This software has been developed with Python 3.10.
We recommend installation via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
To install this software clone this repository or download it. When you navigated to the top level of your local copy use

    pip install -e .

to install all necessary packages to run the code.  

### Optional Packages
To achieve similar results to the paper you need to install two additional optional software components/packages.

#### MPI & mpi4py
[MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) is needed to compute the batch in parallel as intended. For more information on how to install MPI see [here](https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/installing-open-mpi/quickstart.html). For many Linux distributions it is already installed.  
To use MPI with Python we need an interface from the mpi4py package that can be installed via

    pip install mpi4py

#### SuiteSparse & scikit-umfpack
[SuiteSparse](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) is "a suite of sparse matrix algorithms". Among others, it includes *UMFPACK*, a multifrontal LU factorization. This implementation can be used instead of the standard implementation of `splu` by SciPy. How SuiteSparse & scikit-umfpack can be installed is described [here](https://scikit-umfpack.github.io/scikit-umfpack/install.html). If the software is installed correctly, the UMFPACK-implementation is used automatically.
